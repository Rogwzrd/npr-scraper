# NPR-SCRAPER

This project is an example of a full stack application that uses Handlebars, Mongodb, Mongoose, Morgan, and cheerio to scrape the NPR webpage to scrap articles to a database. From there users can then select specific articles to save for to view later and also add notes. The users can also update and/or delete these notes.
